In the third homework, named semaphores were used in order to solve the unisex bathroom problem. They were used to be able to 
execute the program on Mac, since unnamed semaphores were not supported. When solving the problem, four different semaphores were used. 
One called "womenLock" and another "menLock" which helped separating the bathroom from being used by both women and men. When a women was
in the bathroom, the semaphore was set to 0 which made it impossible for men to enter (and the same for the women when a man enterered the 
bathroom). To make to queuing system fair, the semaphores were set so that the last women to enter the bathroom, unlocked the queue for 
the men, so that they could enter, and vice versa. The two other semaphores were called "x" and "y" and were used to control the
number of threads that could access the methods regarding the entering and queuing systems, so that race conditions would be avoided.
