We solved the problem by implementing a monitor called SharedBathroom that synchronizes access to a shared bathroom, allowing multiple men or women to use it simultaneously but never together. By using synchronized methods and wait() and notifyAll(), we ensured that only one gender group at a time could enter. Each person calls manEnter or womanEnter to request access and manExit or womanExit upon leaving. A turn-based system was implemented to alternate access fairly, ensuring that when the bathroom becomes available, only those who were in the queue at that time can enter, preventing indefinite waiting and ensuring fairness for both men and women.
